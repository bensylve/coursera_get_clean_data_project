This repository contains R functionality that summarizes and creates tidy dataset based on the Human Activity Recognition data found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

It also creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The files are exported as text files.

An explanation of the functionality can be found at [Code.md](https://github.com/bensylve/coursera_get_clean_data_project/blob/master/Codebook.md).
